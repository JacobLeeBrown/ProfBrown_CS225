    /**
     * @todo You need to implement this function!
     *
     * This is the basic description of a flood-fill algorithm: Every fill
     * algorithm requires an ordering structure, which is passed to this
     * function via its template parameter. For a breadth-first-search
     * fill, that structure is a Queue, for a depth-first-search, that
     * structure is a Stack. To begin the algorithm, you simply place the
     * given point in the ordering structure. Then, until the structure is
     * empty, you do the following:
     *
     * 1.     Remove a point from the ordering structure.
     *
     *        If it has not been processed before and if its color is
     *        within the tolerance distance (up to and **including**
     *        tolerance away in square-RGB-space-distance) to the original
     *        point's pixel color [that is, \f$(currentRed - OriginalRed)^2 +
              (currentGreen - OriginalGreen)^2 + (currentBlue -
              OriginalBlue)^2 \leq tolerance\f$], then:
     *        1.    indicate somehow that it has been processed (do not mark it
     *              "processed" anywhere else in your code)
     *        2.    change its color in the image using the appropriate
     *              colorPicker
     *        3.    add all of its neighbors to the ordering structure, and
     *        4.    if it is the appropriate frame, send the current PNG to the
     *              animation (as described below).
     * 2.     When implementing your breadth-first-search and
     *        depth-first-search fills, you will need to explore neighboring
     *        pixels in some order.
     *
     *        While the order in which you examine neighbors does not matter
     *        for a proper fill, you must use the same order as we do for
     *        your animations to come out like ours! The order you should put
     *        neighboring pixels **ONTO** the queue or stack is as follows:
     *        **RIGHT(+x), DOWN(+y), LEFT(-x), UP(-y). IMPORTANT NOTE: *UP*
     *        here means towards the top of the image, so since an image has
     *        smaller y coordinates at the top, this is in the *negative y*
     *        direction. Similarly, *DOWN* means in the *positive y*
     *        direction.** To reiterate, when you are exploring (filling out)
     *        from a given pixel, you must first try to fill the pixel to
     *        it's RIGHT, then the one DOWN from it, then to the LEFT and
     *        finally UP. If you do them in a different order, your fill may
     *        still work correctly, but your animations will be different
     *        from the grading scripts!
     * 3.     For every k pixels filled, **starting at the kth pixel**, you
     *        must add a frame to the animation, where k = frameFreq.
     *
     *        For example, if frameFreq is 4, then after the 4th pixel has
     *        been filled you should add a frame to the animation, then again
     *        after the 8th pixel, etc.  You must only add frames for the
     *        number of pixels that have been filled, not the number that
     *        have been checked. So if frameFreq is set to 1, a pixel should
     *        be filled every frame.
